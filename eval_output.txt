Reinforcing Concept: 'How does backpropagation actually update the weights in a neural network?'
The correct answer was: Opt A
------------------------------
Consulting pedagogical resources for the best analogy...

Here is a simpler way to think about it:
1. **The Core Idea**: Backpropagation is a way to fix mistakes in a computer's learning process by adjusting the connections between its "brain cells".
2. **The Everyday Analogy**: Imagine you're trying to get to a secret treasure in a maze. You take a path, but it leads to a dead end. To find the correct path, you go back through the maze, fixing the wrong turns you made, so you can try again. In a neural network, the "maze" is like the layers of brain cells, and the "wrong turns" are like the mistakes in the connections between them.
3. **How it Works**: When the computer makes a mistake, it goes back through the "maze" (the layers of brain cells), finds the wrong turns (the mistakes in the connections), and fixes them. It does this by calculating how much each connection contributed to the mistake, and then adjusting it to make the next attempt more accurate. This process is like leaving breadcrumbs in the maze, so the computer can learn from its mistakes and find the treasure (the correct answer) faster next time.
4. **Quick Recap**: Backpropagation is like navigating a maze, where the computer goes back, fixes its mistakes, and adjusts its path to find the correct answer more efficiently.

Reinforcing Concept: 'Why does entropy always increase in a closed system?'
The correct answer was: Opt A
------------------------------
Consulting pedagogical resources for the best analogy...

Here is a simpler way to think about it:
1. **The Core Idea**: Things tend to get more messy and disorganized over time in a closed space.
2. **The Everyday Analogy**: Imagine you have a toy room where you keep all your toys and books organized on shelves. But one day, you start playing and taking things out, and soon the room becomes a mess with toys and books all over the floor. This is similar to what happens in a closed system, where things naturally become more disorganized and messy over time.
3. **How it Works**: Just like how it's easier for your toy room to become messy than to stay organized, it's easier for things in a closed system to become more disorganized and random. This is because there are many more ways for things to be messy than to be perfectly organized. So, over time, the system will naturally move towards a more messy and disorganized state, which is what we call an increase in entropy.
4. **Quick Recap**: Things get more messy and disorganized over time in a closed space because it's just more likely for things to be that way, and that's why entropy always increases.
